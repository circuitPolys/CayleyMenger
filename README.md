# CayleyMenger
Combinatorial Resultants, Combinatorial Resultant Trees and Circuit Polynomials in the Cayley Menger ideal

Requires: Wolfram Mathematica

Platform: any that supports Mathematica

Description: This repository contains

(i) a database of circuit polynomials in Cayley-Menger ideals, i.e. the minimal dependencies in the algebraic matroids of Cayley-Manger ideals. At prestent the database contains, up to relabeling, all circuit polynomials on 4, 5 and 6 vertices, as well as some circuit polynomials on 7 vertices and some on 8 vertices.

(ii) the enumeration of truncated combinatorial resultant trees for 3-connected rigidity circuits on 6, 7 and 8 vertices.
