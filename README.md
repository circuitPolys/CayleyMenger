# CayleyMenger
Circuit Polynomials in the Cayley Menger ideal

Requires: Wolfram Mathematica

Platform: any that supports Mathematica

Description: This repository contains a database of circuit polynomials in Cayley-Menger ideals, i.e. the minimal dependencies in the algebraic matroids of Cayley-Manger ideals. At prestent the database contains, up to relabeling, all circuit polynomials on 4, 5 and 6 vertices, as well as some circuit polynomials on 7 vertices.

The polynomials are saved in Mathematica's compressed .wdx format and have to be indivitually imported into a notebook.
A tutorial on how to import the poylnomials is presented in the ImportPolynomialTutorial.nb notebook.

Circuit polynomials in the database (filename - corresponding sparsity circuit):

<b>k4.wdx</b> - complete graph on 4 vertices

<b>wheel4.wdx</b> - wheel on 4 vertices
  
<b>doubleBanana2D.wdx</b> - the two-dimensional "double banana"

<b>wheel5.wdx</b> - wheel on 5 vertices

<b>desarguesPlusOne.wdx</b> - the "Desargues" graph (a.k.a the Doublet, a.k.a. Prism or 3-Prism) together with an additional edge

<b>k33PlusOne.wdx</b> - the complete bipartite graph K(3,3) (a.k.a. the Utility graph, a.k.a the Thomsen graph) together with an additional edge
