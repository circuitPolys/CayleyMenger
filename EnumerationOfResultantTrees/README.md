Enumeraton of truncated combinatorial trees for 3-connected rigidity circuits on 6, 7 and 8 vertices.

Requires: Wolfram Mathematica

Platform: any that supports Mathematica

Description: This repository contains the results of the enumeration of truncated combinatorial trees for 3-connected rigidity circuits on 6, 7 and 8 vertices. The circuits were obtained by applying every possible Henneberg-2 move starting with the three 3-connected circuits on 6 vertices and pruning isomorphic copies. The notebook ResultsOfEnumeration.nb contains complete nodespaces for all the circuits.

To do: include a rendering function for the CR-trees; generate data for 9 and 10 vertices (possible, but time-consuming).
